# BASE PROJECT - REACT

I use this to start base project in React.

## What it's using?

- Vite
  For local HTTP server.

- TailwindCSS
  A utility-first CSS framework.

## What it's different from doing manually?

- Better .gitignore.
- Already configured TailwindCSS with Vite.
- Already configured Eslint rules.
- Removed mock files and folders.
- Add folder structure.

## Initial configuration

1. Copy the folder
2. Change the project informations inside de following files:

- ./index.html
- ./package.json

3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
